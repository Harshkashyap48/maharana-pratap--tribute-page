      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Pratap Singh I, commonly known as Maharana Pratap (c. 9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), was a Hindu Rajah of Mewar from the Sisodia Dynasty, its king. He fought several major battles against Akbar, including the Battle of Hardi Ghatti in 1576 to challenge the expanding rule of the Mughal Empire. Pratap became a folk hero because of his military defense from the guerrilla warfare that ensued in the wake of rebels against Mughals like Malik Anbar and Shivaji.

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Maharana Pratap was crowned King of Mewar II in 1540, the year Udai Singh ascended the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh. He was born as the child of Udai Singh and Jaiwanta Bai. His younger brothers are Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmar Singh. Pratap also has two sisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. He was married to Maharani Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia Amar Singhi.
        After Udai Singh's death in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to ascend to the throne  but senior courtiers preferred that her eldest son Pratap be their king. The views of the nobles prevailed, and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharaja Pratap, 54th ruler of Mewar, from the Rajput family of Sisodia. Jagmar promised revenge, went to Ajmer, joined Akbar's army, and received the city of Jahazpur as a gift in the form of a Jagir in return for his help.
